                </div>
                <div class="sec-text">I have spent the last decade hiring software engineers for Fortune 500 tech companies.
                    While I greatly enjoyed building out high performing tech teams with top of class individuals that embodied both the technical and cultural requirements of what the organization was seeking, I felt that I had more to give...<br /><br />
                    Truthfully, I want to BUILD!<br />
                    I want to DESIGN and ENGINEER the next ground-breaking applications. <br />
                    So I decided to change-course and do something that I didn't just like, but LOVED.<br /><br />

                    In June, I completed an immersive full-stack software engineering boot camp.  <br />
                    Currently, I am continuing to take classes to ruther develop my skills.  I code every day.<br />
                    Additionally, I am also doing work for Hack4LA, a volunteer coding organization. <br />
                    I eagerly anticipate my first significant opportunity to come knocking.
                    <br /><br /> My journey is only just beginning.  I am ENAMORED with seeing the concepts in my brain come alive at my fingertips and on a screen. <br /><br />I'm very much looking forward to all the new challenges that lay ahead.<br /><br />LET'S BUILD SOMETHING RAD!
